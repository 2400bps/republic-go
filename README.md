# Shamir Secret Sharing

The Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) library is a Go implementation of the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme. The original paper describing the scheme was published by Adi Shamir in 1979, but the Wikipedia page is a good starting point for readers that are not familiar with secret sharing.
